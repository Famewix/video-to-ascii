# video-to-ascii

A Python script that turns video frames to ascii images and prints them, nice and BASIC.

Turning the PIL image to an ascii image was done by using <a href="https://dev.to/anuragrana/generating-ascii-art-from-colored-image-using-python-4ace">This Blog's</a> code, so props to the author.
